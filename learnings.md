* You don't have to explicitly elicit feedback from people to get feedback on your talk! If people ask you questions, it's likely about something they find interesting but you didn't give enough detail about. Elaborate on those areas for the next talk!

* Pair programming is totally great for learning even when neither of you knows how to solve the problem at hand! David asked me to help with a regex issue on Lua, and although I'd never heard of the Lua language before and don't have much experience using regex, I was able to help him think of the right questions to ask/Google to solve the problem.
