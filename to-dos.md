### Spontaneous, Arguably Interesting Things I Did
* [x] Late-night experiment with migrating personal website hosted on WordPress to GitHub pages with Pelican. Pelican is fairly friendly with WordPress .xml output, as it has a built-in tool that converts the .xml files to .md files (which Pelican then converts to HTML), but not all of my embedded code gets transferred perfectly. Thus I'll have to manually edit the resulting .md files. Because of this, if I want to transfer my site to GitHub/Pelican, I should do so sooner rather than later, in order to minimize the number of .md files (one per post) I have to edit. This is a good project for the weekend.

### Spontaneous, Arguably Interesting Things I Did
* [x] Helped David with using regex to build a parser with Lua. Essentially he wanted a tool that would look at patterns like "name_of_thing = value_of_thing" or "name_of_thing=value_of_thing" and parse them into key, value pairs.
