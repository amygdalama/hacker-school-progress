What do I want to get out of Hacker School?
====================

* Greater confidence, honesty, self-awareness, bravery
* Gain expertise in Python, Data Analysis, Machine Learning (currently beginner-/intermediate-level)
* Join a community of programmers/math nerds who will help motivate me to achieve greatness
* Frankly, a job

What do I want to accomplish at Hacker School?
====================

* One large (1-month) project which requires pulling data from many sources and applying a recommender system, probably to recommend an optimal brunch spot for me, because brunch is awesome. This idea is inspired by Hilary Mason.
* A plethora of varying, small (1-day) analysis and machine learning projects

* Blog posts galore (3-5 per week) with a focus on writing tutorials/explaining benefits of various packages
* A successful pull request, contributing to an open source project or an existing tutorial
* Create a Python package (maybe with functions based on Jaynesâ€™ Probability Theory: The Logic of Science), learn how packaging works
* Learn how to write tests for my code, and make writing tests a habit
* Give a talk! (eeeep!)
* Revamped website possibly using Pelican/GitHub pages (nonessential, not a priority)
* Murdered out GitHub account (a pleasant side effect of all of the above)
