What do I want to accomplish at Hacker School?
====================

+ One large (1-month) project which requires pulling data from many sources and applying a recommender system, probably to recommend an optimal brunch spot for me, because brunch is awesome. This idea is inspired by Hilary Mason.
+ A plethora of varying, small (1-day) analysis and machine learning projects
+ Blog posts galore (3-5 per week) with a focus on writing tutorials/explaining benefits of various packages
+ A successful pull request, contributing to an open source project or an existing tutorial
+ Create a Python package (maybe with functions based on Jaynesâ€™ Probability Theory: The Logic of Science)
+ Give a talk! (eeeep!)
+ Revamped website possibly using Pelican/GitHub pages (nonessential, not a priority)
+ Murdered out GitHub account (a pleasant side effect of all of the above)
