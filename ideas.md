This is a list of ideas for small projects or blog posts.

* OSX computer setup - installing python with homebrew, getting the scientific stack, essential packages for data analysis and machine learning, dealing with $PATH issues, removing multiple pythons, setting up subl, etc

* Quantified Self - determine optimal schedule for maximizing productivity at Hacker School. Record when I took breaks, how long they were, how many hours I spent feeling productive, sleeping schedule (Sleep Cycle), how much alcohol I consumed.
