This is a list of ideas for small projects or blog posts.

* Blog post - my approach to reading code, figuring out tutorials: don't understand a function? Start with the most naive way you could possibly write it and attempt to make it work. Doesn't work? Iteratively read the errors, or view the mistakes, and make small adjustments to your function to work better. Eventually you'll get to a function that looks exactly like the one you were tring

* Basilip - a LISP interpreter written in Python

* A Python script that gives you a list of functions that use each module you're importing (i.e. helps you identify when you're importing a module you're actually not using)

* OSX computer setup - installing python with homebrew, getting the scientific stack, essential packages for data analysis and machine learning, dealing with $PATH issues, removing multiple pythons, setting up subl, etc

* Quantified Self - determine optimal schedule for maximizing productivity at Hacker School. Record when I took breaks, how long they were, how many hours I spent feeling productive, sleeping schedule (Sleep Cycle), how much alcohol I consumed.
